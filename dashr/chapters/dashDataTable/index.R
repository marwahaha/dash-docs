> *Dash DataTable is an interactive table component designed for viewing, 
> editing, and exploring large datasets.*
>
> *DataTable is rendered with standard, 
> semantic HTML `<table/>` markup, which makes it accessible, 
> responsive, and easy to style.*
>
> *7 months in the making, this is the most complex Dash component that Plotly has written, 
> all from the ground-up using React and TypeScript. 
> DataTable was designed with a featureset that allows 
> that Dash users to create complex, spreadsheet driven applications with no compromises. 
> We're excited to continue to work with users and companies that 
> [invest in DataTable's future](https://plot.ly/products/consulting-and-oem/?_ga=2.1935537.1022559183.1559571095-1541667138.1549398001).*

> *DataTable is in `Alpha`. This is more of a statement on the DataTable API rather than on its features. 
> The table currently works beautifully and is already used in production at F500 companies. 
> However, we expect to make a few more breaking changes to its API and behavior within the next couple of months. 
> Once the community feels good about its API, we'll lock it down and we'll commit to reducing the frequency of 
> breaking changes. Please subscribe to 
> [dash-table#207](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/207) and 
> the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to 
> stay up-to-date with any breaking changes.*
> 
> *So, check out DataTable and let us know what you think. Or even better, 
> share your DataTable Dash apps on the 
> [community forum](https://community.plot.ly/t/show-and-tell-community-thread/7554?_ga=2.70598800.1022559183.1559571095-1541667138.1549398001)!*
